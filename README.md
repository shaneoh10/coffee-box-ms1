# Website for Coffee Box

## Code Institute Milestone Project 1 : User-Centric Front End Development

Coffee Box is a fictional company that offers a monthly coffee delivery subscription service.  The website will contain information on the services offered by Coffee Box with the goal of acquiring new customers to sign up for the service. The website will have a warm, friendly feel to it which will encourage users to trust Coffee Box and sign up to the service. Users will have access to a contact form to easily send any queries relating to the service directly to Coffee Box.

## UX

## Strategy

The Coffee Box website is for users who are looking to purchase boutique coffee on a monthly recurring delivery subscription.  The users may be looking to purchase coffee monthly for personal use at home or they may want to purchase once off as a gift or a trial run of the service. So as not to limit the services of Coffee Box to specific customers the website will entice all coffee lovers to subscribe to the service. Although the service is not limited to a target audience, one specific group may be professional individuals who are working from home and are looking for a delivery service to keep their coffee supply topped up from month to month.  The users of the Coffee Box website will want to see clear information about the service (price, amount of coffee, frequency of deliveries/charges) so that they can choose the subscription that best fits their budget and coffee requirements.

#### As a user I want to:
* view various subscription costs to determine if the service is within budget.
* view a simple breakdown of information on how the service works.
* be able to view the website on various devices (mobile, tablet, desktop)
* easily contact Coffee Box with any queries regarding the service.
* view testimonials from staisfied customers to authenticate the services of Coffee Box.
* be able to instinctively navigate the website to efficiently find any information required.
* be easily directed to any social media channels to connect with Coffee Box to stay up to date with any offers or other viewing material.

## Scope 

After analysis of the user stories, I have decided on the following features to be my initial minimum scope:
* Responsive design 
* Subscription service information and prices
* Information on how it works
* Satisfied customer testimonials
* Contact form
* Links to social media channels

## Structure

I decided to keep the structure of the website similar to what users will have previously experienced and so I researched other coffee subscription websites in order to keep up with current structure trends. I found that a lot of websites were one-page scrollers but did not use a traditional navbar, so I decided to opt for the one-page scroller structure with a traditional navbar to give users a friendly and familiar experience while using the site.

I have structured the site with: 
* A brand logo on the left and navbar to the right as users would be familiar with
* A collapsible navbar hamburger icon to save screen space on smaller devices
* One-page scroller with each section leading on to the next, users should not feel lost
* Social media icons on the footer
* Main content written using bootstrap for mobile first responsive design

## Skeleton

I used Balsamiq to design wireframes for mobile, tablet and desktop. These wireframes can be viewed [here](https://github.com/shaneoh10/coffee-box-ms1/blob/master/assets/documents/coffee-box.pdf)

## Surface 

#### Colours

I chose a warm neutral colour palette to contrast with earthy background images to create a relaxed and comfortable feel, as would be associated with enjoying a cup of coffee.

* #FAFAFA - off white colour
* #E17131 - Spanish orange
* #FFCB97 - Peach crayota
* #E8E8E8 - Platinum
* #D3D0CB - Timberwolf
* #F0EFEB - Isabelline
* #65524D - Umber

#### Typography 

I have chosen JetBrains Mono as the main font throughout the website and Dancing Script for the main headers to provide the users with a friendly and welcoming feel.

## Features 

#### Across the page: 
* The navbar will be visible across the whole web page with a feature where it is hidden on scroll down and re-appears at the top of the screen when the user begins to scroll up. The navbar shows the Coffee Box logo on the left and there are four website sections available to travel to on the right-hand side: Home, About, Prices, Contact Us. The navbar also collapses into a hamburger icon on smaller screens.

#### Home Section: 
* A background image of a cup of coffee and coffee beans. This high-quality image will give users a first impression of a warm and welcoming professional service.  The image also ties in with the warm and earthy colour palette chosen for the site.
* A central main heading containing the company slogan and sub-heading providing a brief description of the service, quickly draw user attention to the centre of the page.
* Two buttons, a sign-up call-to-action and a tell me more button to encourage users to either sign up to the service or continue to browse the website to learn more about the service.  The sign-up button is an orange colour to attract user attention.
