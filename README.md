# Website for Coffee Box

## Code Institute Milestone Project 1 : User-Centric Front End Development

Coffee Box is a fictional company that offers a monthly coffee delivery subscription service.  The website will contain information on the services offered by Coffee Box with the goal of acquiring new customers to sign up for the service. The website will have a warm, friendly feel to it which will encourage users to trust Coffee Box and sign up to the service. Users will have access to a contact form to easily send any queries relating to the service directly to Coffee Box.

## UX

## Strategy

The Coffee Box website is for users who are looking to purchase boutique coffee on a monthly recurring delivery subscription.  The users may be looking to purchase coffee monthly for personal use at home or they may want to purchase once off as a gift or a trial run of the service. So as not to limit the services of Coffee Box to specific customers the website will entice all coffee lovers to subscribe to the service. Although the service is not limited to a target audience, one specific group may be professional individuals who are working from home and are looking for a delivery service to keep their coffee supply topped up from month to month.  The users of the Coffee Box website will want to see clear information about the service (price, amount of coffee, frequency of deliveries/charges) so that they can choose the subscription that best fits their budget and coffee requirements.

#### As a user I want to:
* view various subscription costs to determine if the service is within budget.
* view a simple breakdown of information on how the service works.
* be able to view the website on various devices (mobile, tablet, desktop)
* easily contact Coffee Box with any queries regarding the service.
* view testimonials from staisfied customers to authenticate the services of Coffee Box.
* be able to instinctively navigate the website to efficiently find any information required.
* be easily directed to any social media channels to connect with Coffee Box to stay up to date with any offers or other viewing material.

## Scope 

After analysis of the user stories, I have decided on the following features to be my initial minimum scope:
* Responsive design 
* Subscription service information and prices
* Information on how it works
* Satisfied customer testimonials
* Contact form
* Links to social media channels

## Structure

I decided to keep the structure of the website similar to what users will have previously experienced and so I researched other coffee subscription websites in order to keep up with current structure trends. I found that a lot of websites were one-page scrollers but did not use a traditional navbar, so I decided to opt for the one-page scroller structure with a traditional navbar to give users a friendly and familiar experience while using the site.

I have structured the site with: 
* A brand logo on the left and navbar to the right as users would be familiar with
* A collapsible navbar hamburger icon to save screen space on smaller devices
* One-page scroller with each section leading on to the next, users should not feel lost
* Social media icons on the footer
* Main content written using bootstrap for mobile first responsive design

## Skeleton

I used Balsamiq to design wireframes for mobile, tablet and desktop. These wireframes can be viewed [here](https://github.com/shaneoh10/coffee-box-ms1/blob/master/assets/documents/coffee-box.pdf)
